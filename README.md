# word-guess-game

Do you like movies? Well So do I! Thus the reason I went ahead and made a Word Guessing Game.
Think Hangman, but without the killing of an innocent stick figure.

## Instructions:
-Type something on your keyboard
-See if the letter is in the word
-If letter is not in the word, try again
-If the letter is in the word, Jump For Joy! ...and repeat
-If you loose, it will tell you that you lost, and make a sad sound
-If you win, then you win! 
-Play again
